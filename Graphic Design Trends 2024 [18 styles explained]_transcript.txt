in this video we'll be discussing the (0.0 - 4.2)
graphic design Trends and styles that (2.22 - 6.24)
you need to know this year we're talking (4.2 - 8.58)
web design posters branding and (6.24 - 10.32)
packaging so whether you're a seasoned (8.58 - 12.54)
designer or just starting out these (10.32 - 14.34)
Trends should give you some Sparks of (12.54 - 16.858999999999998)
inspiration for your next project first (14.34 - 19.22)
Trend slash Style on this list is (16.859 - 22.14)
neo-brutalism brutalism has been used in (19.22 - 24.06)
graphic design for a very long time it (22.14 - 26.64)
often disregards traditional layout (24.06 - 29.759999999999998)
Styles and principles using large blocks (26.64 - 31.859)
of text that may be difficult to read (29.76 - 34.620000000000005)
and high contrast in colors it was (31.859 - 37.14)
originally popular in poster and graphic (34.62 - 39.419999999999995)
design although some attempts were made (37.14 - 41.64)
in the late 90s to bring it to the web (39.42 - 43.980000000000004)
Neo brutalism combines traditional (41.64 - 46.980000000000004)
layout concepts with solid colors simple (43.98 - 49.86)
yet unique typography it's not afraid to (46.98 - 51.959999999999994)
use pure black with other colors yet (49.86 - 54.78)
we're talking hashtag zero zero zero (51.96 - 57.739000000000004)
zero zero zero so we're talking bold (54.78 - 61.620000000000005)
contrasty raw organic like materials I (57.739 - 63.419999999999995)
actually quite like the Resurgence it's (61.62 - 65.339)
had the push to the more kind of (63.42 - 67.08)
colorful and playful direction that (65.339 - 70.32)
we're seeing in the UI of this app here (67.08 - 72.479)
the not so great thing however is we've (70.32 - 74.52)
seen a whole bunch of Brands rushing (72.479 - 77.1)
towards Neo brutalism and rebranding (74.52 - 79.619)
themselves in a pretty much similar (77.1 - 81.6)
manner one that we all know is Gum Road (79.619 - 83.88)
don't really know why they rebranded to (81.6 - 85.64)
this to be honest I didn't feel like (83.88 - 88.14)
neo-brutalism was the right Road for (85.64 - 90.96000000000001)
them Road I feel like I've seen it too (88.14 - 92.7)
many times and then I like the other (90.96 - 94.38)
extreme which is the more refined (92.7 - 97.32000000000001)
minimalism look we're talking playful (94.38 - 100.14)
kind of modern type but against the (97.32 - 102.77999999999999)
utilitarian look of minimalist design (100.14 - 105.6)
we've also seen a lot of pixels and then (102.78 - 107.82000000000001)
the more traditional Neo brutalist dark (105.6 - 110.03999999999999)
with the one gradient style the next (107.82 - 112.86)
trend on the list is pop futurism the (110.04 - 116.93900000000001)
1980s are back glows gradients textures (112.86 - 119.46)
and an illustrated look it's quite nice (116.939 - 121.5)
to see this as a Resurgence although I (119.46 - 123.36)
think we've not moved it on enough one (121.5 - 124.56)
of the things you notice a lot about (123.36 - 127.439)
this Hop futurism look is the use of (124.56 - 129.899)
glows and more textural feel of the (127.439 - 131.51999999999998)
illustration one of the things that (129.899 - 133.5)
we're seeing a lot of in this specific (131.52 - 136.92000000000002)
style is a retro throwback to elements (133.5 - 139.62)
such as game boys old school Tech things (136.92 - 141.72)
that actually bring the Nostalgia back (139.62 - 144.0)
the advancement on this trend and style (141.72 - 145.68)
that I really like is how it's been (144.0 - 148.44)
fused with the maximalism style where (145.68 - 150.18)
we've put in these retro illustrations (148.44 - 151.92)
and kind of overloading them to make (150.18 - 154.08)
pretty cool compositions a bit more (151.92 - 155.7)
digital Arty but I think these things (154.08 - 157.8)
look awesome the next Trend we will (155.7 - 160.56)
continue to see this year is the Y2K (157.8 - 163.86)
Evolution the Y2K Evolution refers back (160.56 - 165.72)
to the Y2K aesthetic which is (163.86 - 168.12)
essentially the design style of the late (165.72 - 171.72)
90s and early 2000s as we came into what (168.12 - 174.72)
I call New Media or the internet this (171.72 - 176.879)
aesthetic is a nostalgic style that (174.72 - 179.459)
basically draws on the elements of what (176.879 - 182.099)
it looked like to be alive on the early (179.459 - 184.019)
web characterized by bright and bold (182.099 - 187.319)
colors pixelated imagery and cybernetic (184.019 - 189.48000000000002)
themes with the Y2K aesthetic you can (187.319 - 191.42)
expect to see plenty of holograms (189.48 - 194.64)
Nettles liquid Metals pixels and a (191.42 - 197.57999999999998)
general dose of futurism things like the (194.64 - 199.67999999999998)
early Bjork artwork a lot of throwback (197.58 - 202.44000000000003)
to the early internet windows we see a (199.68 - 204.239)
lot of distorted type and holographic (202.44 - 206.64)
themes one of my favorite uses of this (204.239 - 209.34)
in branding is the Lego and Levi's (206.64 - 210.89999999999998)
collaboration where they took the whole (209.34 - 214.26)
Y2K aesthetic made it pixely using the (210.9 - 216.18)
Lego blocks and I think they just nailed (214.26 - 218.099)
the colors the look and feel and the (216.18 - 220.5)
throwback Nostalgia a sub Trend in (218.099 - 223.26)
itself is the liquid Metals use we're (220.5 - 225.36)
seeing a lot of chrome liquid Metals (223.26 - 227.39999999999998)
Graphics the liquify tool is being (225.36 - 230.09900000000002)
heavily used in branded imagery and (227.4 - 232.68)
promo styles again looking at the block (230.099 - 235.2)
colors it was almost like it was early (232.68 - 237.65900000000002)
Japanese feel blended with the internet (235.2 - 241.5)
very pop Arty General feeling of this (237.659 - 243.84)
aesthetic the next style slash Trend (241.5 - 245.64)
that we're seeing is what I'm calling (243.84 - 248.76)
typo Fusion which is essentially just (245.64 - 251.099)
creative typography While most Trend (248.76 - 252.89999999999998)
lists that you've seen or I certainly (251.099 - 254.7)
have seen is either saying Sans serif (252.9 - 256.859)
fonts are making a comeback or serif (254.7 - 258.359)
fonts are making a comeback I think it's (256.859 - 260.21999999999997)
all rubbish typography in general is (258.359 - 261.68)
becoming a lot more experimental (260.22 - 264.47900000000004)
expressive and creative serif fonts (261.68 - 266.58)
which are characterized with the top and (264.479 - 268.919)
bottom lines at the letters have (266.58 - 271.44)
definitely had a Resurgence in the last (268.919 - 273.53999999999996)
few years that Trend in particular has (271.44 - 275.88)
been driven by the sense of security (273.54 - 278.34000000000003)
that the tradition of the serif itself (275.88 - 279.9)
evokes and this is particularly (278.34 - 282.59999999999997)
important in today's world where most (279.9 - 285.53999999999996)
brand consumerism is predicated on trust (282.6 - 287.699)
further to this we're seeing a lot of (285.54 - 290.16)
movement especially this kind of retro (287.699 - 293.46000000000004)
3D aesthetic but the reality is not one (290.16 - 295.97900000000004)
font or the other font is taking a lead (293.46 - 297.96)
they are both being used in equal (295.979 - 299.75899999999996)
measure by different people for (297.96 - 302.34)
different purposes and again I carry out (299.759 - 304.259)
all points when it comes to trends that (302.34 - 307.25899999999996)
it is how you use Styles the way that (304.259 - 309.6)
you design should solve a problem and (307.259 - 312.36)
not follow a specific Trend the next (309.6 - 315.18)
style or Trend we are seeing is the (312.36 - 318.6)
return of retro vintage this trend in (315.18 - 321.02)
graphic design is typified by early (318.6 - 324.41900000000004)
1980s advertising style this also pushes (321.02 - 326.28)
into the 90s a little bit more taking in (324.419 - 328.25899999999996)
the texture of the grain which is (326.28 - 330.479)
prominent in this visual style we see a (328.259 - 333.41900000000004)
lot of geometric shapes and minimalist (330.479 - 336.0)
layout a lot of refined simplification (333.419 - 338.15999999999997)
we tend to see a lot of stickers and (336.0 - 340.38)
also line art like here you can see the (338.16 - 342.90000000000003)
old school Nike ads which use the Big (340.38 - 345.84)
Font Futura along with just a simple (342.9 - 348.78)
image and their logo absolute took their (345.84 - 351.29999999999995)
own spin on this by using the simplified (348.78 - 354.65999999999997)
grainy and refined aesthetic with the (351.3 - 357.06)
high contrast product photography which (354.66 - 359.34000000000003)
is also a micro Trend in itself going (357.06 - 363.12)
wider into the Retro vintage aesthetic (359.34 - 365.15999999999997)
we're starting to see a lot more line (363.12 - 368.1)
art yes we're talking the return of sign (365.16 - 370.62)
painter and some more of these cool (368.1 - 373.38)
cartoony Graphics which were typified by (370.62 - 377.16)
70s American design style stickers are a (373.38 - 378.96)
trend that we've been seeing emerge over (377.16 - 380.88000000000005)
the last couple years they're everywhere (378.96 - 383.28)
and we'll continue to see more of this (380.88 - 386.819)
as they have a very useful role to play (383.28 - 389.63899999999995)
in branding they are great for using as (386.819 - 391.86)
accents to a brand to extend the message (389.639 - 395.039)
or to bring something to life here's a (391.86 - 397.319)
really cool example of something more (395.039 - 399.0)
recent from Nike where they took some of (397.319 - 400.44)
those cues from earlier in the near (399.0 - 403.88)
brutalism where they had the simplified (400.44 - 407.4)
fonts interchanged with the imagery and (403.88 - 410.58)
then overlaid with some retro design the (407.4 - 411.84)
next style and Trend we're talking about (410.58 - 414.96)
is modern surrealism as we spend more (411.84 - 417.71999999999997)
time in the digital world and less in (414.96 - 420.0)
physical places the lines are are (417.72 - 421.8)
getting blurred surrealism is an (420.0 - 423.479)
enduringly popular design approach (421.8 - 425.40000000000003)
because of its novelty and endless (423.479 - 428.52)
original weirdness lots of airbrushing (425.4 - 432.12)
abstract shapes and textures some of the (428.52 - 434.15999999999997)
cool ways we're seeing modern surrealism (432.12 - 436.56)
at the moment is how brands are using (434.16 - 438.96000000000004)
this textured almost painty type feel (436.56 - 441.72)
and those work really well on the (438.96 - 443.69899999999996)
texture of cardboard when it's produced (441.72 - 446.639)
in a packaging and Physical Realm the (443.699 - 448.56)
next style is what I'm calling still (446.639 - 451.5)
tripping or trippy it's a little bit of (448.56 - 453.72)
an extension to Modern surrealism but (451.5 - 456.12)
really going more into psychedelic (453.72 - 459.06)
surrealism maybe because loads of people (456.12 - 461.28000000000003)
are doing micro dosing these days that (459.06 - 463.8)
this has become popular but again it's (461.28 - 465.65999999999997)
going back to that macro trend of (463.8 - 468.18)
escaping reality so what we're seeing is (465.66 - 470.24)
a lot of kind of acid visuals (468.18 - 474.24)
psychedelic illustrations warped imagery (470.24 - 478.139)
and a general depiction of a dystopian (474.24 - 480.78000000000003)
World some really cool uses I've seen on (478.139 - 483.18)
this is taking some of the Y2K aesthetic (480.78 - 485.58)
and bringing it into this kind of new (483.18 - 487.979)
dimension Brands like Sonos have taken (485.58 - 490.56)
their trippy psychedelic visuals and (487.979 - 492.65999999999997)
made them part and parcel of their core (490.56 - 494.819)
product photography which looks awesome (492.66 - 498.41900000000004)
and then we've got some more uses of the (494.819 - 501.41900000000004)
wacky illustrations in some of like the (498.419 - 503.52)
energy drinks and the beers and then (501.419 - 506.15999999999997)
we're just seeing some really cool like (503.52 - 509.94)
airbrushed trippy photos another cool (506.16 - 513.1800000000001)
application of the Psychedelic visuals (509.94 - 516.36)
are taking the old retro stickers and (513.18 - 518.399)
obviously bringing that kind of 60s (516.36 - 521.76)
hippie Nostalgia into the design and (518.399 - 525.06)
Brands such as meltdown are combining (521.76 - 527.58)
this really well on their packaging the (525.06 - 529.5)
next style of trend that we are seeing (527.58 - 532.5)
is new maximalism the last few years (529.5 - 534.959)
minimal trend has taken a bit of a (532.5 - 537.54)
U-turn designers are using this as an (534.959 - 540.1199999999999)
escape from uninspiring routine gains (537.54 - 542.04)
and restrictions so we're seeing bold (540.12 - 544.14)
and explosive colors Optical (542.04 - 546.899)
illustrations and Illusions lots of (544.14 - 549.8389999999999)
shapes it's just generally chaotic to be (546.899 - 551.519)
honest but some of these brands are (549.839 - 553.86)
doing it really really well why it's (551.519 - 556.8)
done a really cool front cover with what (553.86 - 559.86)
lies ahead and again it's just evoking (556.8 - 562.5)
that feeling of Chaos in true designer (559.86 - 564.48)
style there is now and then some (562.5 - 566.82)
organization in it which we can all (564.48 - 569.22)
appreciate it just looks beautiful to be (566.82 - 572.6400000000001)
honest just a general mishmash of shapes (569.22 - 575.399)
and feeling the next Trend and style (572.64 - 578.459)
that we're seeing this is a big one it (575.399 - 581.519)
is artificial morphism no we're not (578.459 - 584.459)
talking scuromorphism or neuromorphism (581.519 - 586.38)
we're actually talking some sort of (584.459 - 589.26)
weird hybrid baby of both of them (586.38 - 593.7)
artificial morphism is making a huge (589.26 - 597.06)
impact right now this incredible High (593.7 - 599.279)
Fidelity design power that is coming (597.06 - 602.279)
from the the likes of Dali are making (599.279 - 605.3389999999999)
huge waves by just creating this (602.279 - 608.22)
unbelievable surreal imagery which is (605.339 - 611.7600000000001)
both highly detailed highly textured and (608.22 - 614.279)
it can just literally be any style you (611.76 - 616.5)
want but what we're seeing is a mishmash (614.279 - 619.08)
of this van Gogh painting style being (616.5 - 622.38)
used in a modern form generally this (619.08 - 625.2)
generative way of creating art is (622.38 - 627.42)
actually really interesting and here's (625.2 - 629.88)
some really good examples of fonts that (627.42 - 631.4399999999999)
are being generated completely through (629.88 - 633.899)
Ai and I mean the level of detail from (631.44 - 636.899)
some of this stuff is absolutely insane (633.899 - 638.88)
even in web design we're seeing like (636.899 - 642.24)
super high fidelity nuo skewomorphic (638.88 - 644.88)
feeling interfaces because the texture (642.24 - 647.76)
and richness is more than what we were (644.88 - 650.04)
illustrating previously I really love (647.76 - 653.279)
this series of AI generated sneakers (650.04 - 656.2199999999999)
it's super super cool the next trend is (653.279 - 658.86)
photographic branding and I'm talking a (656.22 - 660.899)
little bit more macro here we're really (658.86 - 663.36)
seeing a reversal away from The High (660.899 - 666.12)
contrasty images that we've seen from a (663.36 - 667.6800000000001)
lot of product photography over the last (666.12 - 671.1)
year people are opting to engage more (667.68 - 673.68)
with realistic imagery and there's no (671.1 - 675.4200000000001)
surprise really the way video content (673.68 - 677.6999999999999)
has gone the mass takeover of tick tock (675.42 - 680.399)
has had us looking at playing people on (677.7 - 683.5790000000001)
their iPhone camera super flat not the (680.399 - 686.399)
best cinematic videos we've seen and (683.579 - 688.7399999999999)
we're starting to see this bleed into (686.399 - 690.839)
photography as well and the way that (688.74 - 692.279)
brands are using it is they're taking (690.839 - 694.98)
more realistic photos that are less (692.279 - 697.14)
stylized and they're using them full (694.98 - 700.38)
screen big front and center with (697.14 - 702.72)
typography and some refined (700.38 - 704.9399999999999)
illustrations around it the next Trend (702.72 - 707.94)
and or style that we are seeing this (704.94 - 709.5)
one's actually making a comeback it's (707.94 - 712.2)
what I'm calling new grunge and I might (709.5 - 714.12)
have lied earlier when I said brutalism (712.2 - 717.0600000000001)
was my favorite style this one is the (714.12 - 719.399)
style that I started my design career on (717.06 - 722.2199999999999)
and really it it has to be making a (719.399 - 723.779)
comeback the trend is all about rough (722.22 - 725.76)
rugged and slightly vintage aesthetic (723.779 - 727.68)
but we're talking distressed textures (725.76 - 731.64)
muted colors Splats sprays scraps with (727.68 - 734.8199999999999)
the modern day war and activism being a (731.64 - 736.68)
part of the current culture and (734.82 - 738.839)
certainly the way that the Gen Z culture (736.68 - 740.8199999999999)
has taken it on this graphic style has (738.839 - 743.82)
been seen a lot in Esports and what (740.82 - 745.32)
we're seeing is some of the biggest (743.82 - 747.0)
Sport and football clubs in like the (745.32 - 749.4590000000001)
Premier League adopting this Esports (747.0 - 751.32)
aesthetic and applying it to their own (749.459 - 753.42)
football teams design and branding (751.32 - 755.5790000000001)
language next up is a style that I am (753.42 - 758.16)
calling modern Mystic there's been a (755.579 - 760.519)
recent Trend towards incorporating (758.16 - 763.56)
Mystic and otherworldly themes such as (760.519 - 766.74)
spirituality astrology magic and Cosmic (763.56 - 768.66)
designs what we're seeing is more (766.74 - 771.0)
abstract Illustrated and simplified (768.66 - 773.6999999999999)
symbolism and other elements that evolve (771.0 - 775.98)
a sense of mystery this trend has been (773.7 - 777.779)
driven in part by advances in fields (775.98 - 779.339)
such as science philosophy and spiritual (777.779 - 781.68)
reality and really it's manifesting in a (779.339 - 783.1800000000001)
range of design assets and templates (781.68 - 786.06)
including event illustrations logos and (783.18 - 787.62)
branding like these matcha and coffee (786.06 - 789.5999999999999)
brands I think the packaging looks (787.62 - 792.18)
awesome the next trend is geominimalism (789.6 - 793.98)
this one's been around for a while and (792.18 - 796.7399999999999)
we're continuing to see it it's the use (793.98 - 799.26)
of geometric shapes simplified (796.74 - 802.5)
typography Vivid primary colors and (799.26 - 804.899)
blocked off Graphics I particularly like (802.5 - 806.459)
the way that it's being used as a trend (804.899 - 808.079)
against the kind of illustrations that (806.459 - 809.88)
we're seeing all over the Internet and (808.079 - 812.2199999999999)
making those illustrations more refined (809.88 - 814.62)
to work within a wider brand system the (812.22 - 817.32)
use of these geometric shapes with some (814.62 - 819.6)
more abstract shape creates this kind of (817.32 - 821.7)
modern futuristic of feel which I really (819.6 - 823.9200000000001)
like the next design style is (821.7 - 827.1)
utilitarian or what I'm calling minimal (823.92 - 829.1999999999999)
utilitarian overall this has been a (827.1 - 830.94)
design style around forever and I think (829.2 - 833.5790000000001)
we'll continue to see its use as people (830.94 - 835.74)
create more functional products that (833.579 - 837.54)
need to deliver the message of their (835.74 - 839.279)
functionality in a clear and concerned (837.54 - 841.8)
ice manner this design is often used in (839.279 - 843.3)
products and environments where (841.8 - 845.399)
practicality and communication are (843.3 - 847.1999999999999)
important such as Industrial Equipment (845.399 - 849.36)
medical devices and public (847.2 - 852.6)
transportation again this bold minimal (849.36 - 855.0)
graphic and uniform style has been (852.6 - 857.7)
applied to many things in cosmetics as (855.0 - 859.44)
they try to convey that kind of (857.7 - 862.38)
utilitarian use more interestingly we've (859.44 - 863.8800000000001)
seen it on some other products like (862.38 - 866.579)
water and in general this kind of (863.88 - 868.139)
approach is almost a bit like (866.579 - 871.3199999999999)
anti-branding it's the deconstruction of (868.139 - 873.72)
all this noise and other visual elements (871.32 - 876.779)
to communicate a product in its simplest (873.72 - 878.7)
form one of my favorite products is (876.779 - 880.86)
something that I still use today which I (878.7 - 882.4200000000001)
think is discontinued and it's unit (880.86 - 884.6990000000001)
Portables this Swedish design style was (882.42 - 887.639)
very utilitarian and it just was really (884.699 - 889.9799999999999)
a great functioning product the next (887.639 - 891.6)
graphic design style that we're going to (889.98 - 894.1990000000001)
continue to see big in the next year is (891.6 - 896.5790000000001)
neoclassical this trend is all about (894.199 - 898.8)
using elements of classical art and (896.579 - 901.38)
architecture in modern designs take an (898.8 - 904.019)
inspiration from this old school classic (901.38 - 906.6)
art and architecture of ancient Greece (904.019 - 908.579)
and Rome is characterized typically by (906.6 - 911.0400000000001)
the use of symmetry rectilinear forms (908.579 - 913.68)
and a restrained geometric ornamentation (911.04 - 916.5)
I really like these modern takes on the (913.68 - 918.779)
neoclassical design which fuses some of (916.5 - 922.139)
the modern geosimplicity in with these (918.779 - 924.779)
classical shapes and elements it's a (922.139 - 926.76)
Timeless and sophisticated style that (924.779 - 928.56)
conveys a sense of tradition and (926.76 - 930.899)
stability the next design style that (928.56 - 932.699)
we're seeing get a hell of a lot of (930.899 - 936.0)
traction is Art Deco it's a design that (932.699 - 938.579)
originated in the 1920s and when we talk (936.0 - 941.16)
about art deco most people think of cool (938.579 - 944.2199999999999)
Miami buildings hotels but it's recently (941.16 - 946.68)
gaining popularity again it's a design (944.22 - 949.26)
style that combines geometric bold (946.68 - 952.62)
shapes and a lavish and refined feel (949.26 - 954.8389999999999)
more recently the modern take on the art (952.62 - 957.12)
deco style Caesar's fusing some of those (954.839 - 958.98)
earlier retro elements and the texture (957.12 - 962.339)
and grain of these illustrations with a (958.98 - 965.1)
kind of more playful typographic tape on (962.339 - 967.019)
the art deco font we're seeing this used (965.1 - 969.1800000000001)
a lot in kind of makeup branding which (967.019 - 971.76)
is moving away from the utilitarian (969.18 - 973.9799999999999)
minimal aesthetic and here are some (971.76 - 976.5)
really cool examples that show a more (973.98 - 979.26)
minimal and geometric take on the art (976.5 - 981.899)
deco aesthetic the last trend is Art (979.26 - 984.66)
Nouveau and Art Nouveau in style type (981.899 - 986.699)
and Aesthetics this is a style that (984.66 - 989.2199999999999)
emerged in the late 19th century it's (986.699 - 991.8)
characterized by a focus on organic (989.22 - 994.98)
flowing lines and curves we see a lot of (991.8 - 997.8599999999999)
organic natural illustrations in this (994.98 - 1000.38)
style and it's really a kind of refined (997.86 - 1003.92)
retro feeling but it also looks really (1000.38 - 1006.32)
sophisticated Maya is a really cool (1003.92 - 1008.18)
tequila brand that I've implemented this (1006.32 - 1010.88)
style perfectly espresso Republic have (1008.18 - 1013.399)
taken this a step further by refining (1010.88 - 1015.38)
the Aesthetics of Art Nouveau and (1013.399 - 1017.839)
creating a utilitarian feel to the (1015.38 - 1020.0)
design and packaging a lot these Trends (1017.839 - 1022.1600000000001)
work really well if you're creating a (1020.0 - 1023.839)
new brand and if you want to see how I (1022.16 - 1025.459)
created a brand from start to finish (1023.839 - 1027.98)
using some of these Trends check out (1025.459 - 1031.1200000000001)
