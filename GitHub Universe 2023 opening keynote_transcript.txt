dkey good (45.039 - 50.239000000000004)
morning morning thank you for being here (46.719 - 53.120000000000005)
everyone it's so great to see all of you (50.239 - 56.399)
I'm Thomas and I'm a developer and today (53.12 - 58.919999999999995)
is the day I've been waiting for for the (56.399 - 60.84)
last 8 months (58.92 - 63.359)
today what we will do on this stage how (60.84 - 65.799)
we will build what we will launch it (63.359 - 68.43900000000001)
will redefine the essence of software (65.799 - 69.799)
development (68.439 - 72.88)
itself this is a moment long in the (69.799 - 75.47900000000001)
making now if you recall it was just a (72.88 - 77.439)
few weeks after gith up Universe last (75.479 - 80.56)
year when AI had its Big Bang moment (77.439 - 84.32)
Chad GPT exploded onto the scene it (80.56 - 87.60000000000001)
washed over the airwaves it was the most (84.32 - 90.32)
consequential disruption to techn ology (87.6 - 92.72)
since the Advent of the internet browser (90.32 - 94.67999999999999)
our Global Consciousness has not been (92.72 - 96.439)
the same (94.68 - 99.36000000000001)
since but forget up our generative AI (96.439 - 102.19999999999999)
story did not start there it dates back (99.36 - 105.88)
all the way to 2020 and it's documented (102.2 - 108.43900000000001)
in a white paper we internally call the (105.88 - 112.079)
coding Oracle paper back in 2020 a group (108.439 - 114.24)
of our wildly talented Engineers got (112.079 - 116.91999999999999)
their hands on a raw version of open (114.24 - 120.67999999999999)
ai's gpt3 model and with this model that (116.92 - 123.84)
sought to answer a single question was (120.68 - 127.0)
an automated pair programmer fact or (123.84 - 129.36)
fiction could this Transformer model (127.0 - 133.16)
this strange thoughtful machine actually (129.36 - 136.16000000000003)
help solve the tasks of an everyday (133.16 - 139.07999999999998)
developer our team knuckled down and (136.16 - 140.76)
pulled together a bunch of tasks you (139.08 - 142.72)
know like standard exercises developers (140.76 - 145.16)
often do in job interviews I remember (142.72 - 147.2)
hopping on a call and one by one we fed (145.16 - 149.239)
these exercises into the model and (147.2 - 150.39999999999998)
observed (149.239 - 154.48000000000002)
happened and in 2020 out of 203 (150.4 - 157.44)
handcrafted programming exercises then (154.48 - 162.2)
prompted the model solved 93% of them 3 (157.44 - 164.68)
years ago it already solved (162.2 - 167.64)
93% this was the Genesis this was the (164.68 - 170.04000000000002)
moment this is what won me over and I (167.64 - 172.55999999999997)
tell you it takes a lot to win over a (170.04 - 175.07999999999998)
skeptical German (172.56 - 177.68)
developer and our Engineers put that (175.08 - 180.20000000000002)
feeling down and writing that AI I would (177.68 - 183.59900000000002)
and I quote change developer Tools in (180.2 - 186.48)
fundamental ways in particular an (183.599 - 188.39999999999998)
automated pair programmer can be built (186.48 - 190.599)
that puts the collective knowledge of (188.4 - 192.84)
the entire giup community at the (190.599 - 195.319)
fingertips of every individual big (192.84 - 197.84)
statement right early statement but we (195.319 - 200.35999999999999)
took a risk and we built the world's (197.84 - 203.31900000000002)
first at scale a pair programmer a novel (200.36 - 205.799)
tool with a large language model before (203.319 - 208.72)
the world was ready and today with more (205.799 - 211.64000000000001)
than 1 million paid users across 190 (208.72 - 214.4)
countries get up copot is now the most (211.64 - 218.35999999999999)
widely adopted AI developer tool in (214.4 - 218.36)
history and from this worldwide adoption (222.48 - 226.959)
we have seen the most stunning evidence (225.159 - 229.04)
of productivity gains since we got rid (226.959 - 232.04)
of Punch Cards in Assembly Language (229.04 - 235.84)
already copilot is making developers 55% (232.04 - 240.0)
faster in coding a 55% productivity gain (235.84 - 241.879)
the biggest ever experienced in the (240.0 - 245.36)
first year of a novel developer tool and (241.879 - 248.599)
people truly love using it open source (245.36 - 251.799)
maintainers students teachers developers (248.599 - 254.959)
and Fortune 500 companies from Shopify (251.799 - 258.639)
to Marcato libbre to Mercedes to BWC in (254.959 - 261.479)
just a short period of time get up copy (258.639 - 263.52)
has become the greatest competitive (261.479 - 266.199)
advantage in any software driven (263.52 - 269.79999999999995)
business in now over 37,000 organ G (266.199 - 273.479)
ation are using co-pilot to achieve (269.8 - 273.479)
more it's been adopted by organizations (275.72 - 282.0)
at all sizes and across all sectors and (278.32 - 285.4)
industries today the pair programmer we (282.0 - 287.16)
dreamed off in the coding Oracle paper (285.4 - 291.19899999999996)
has accelerated Beyond even our wildest (287.16 - 293.68)
aspirations but AI supported code (291.199 - 295.639)
completion was always just the starting (293.68 - 298.12)
point the change agent for the bigger (295.639 - 300.40000000000003)
picture you know many many professional (298.12 - 302.68)
developers actually only code like two (300.4 - 305.19899999999996)
hours a day so what use is it if (302.68 - 307.0)
developers will blazingly fasten the (305.199 - 309.84000000000003)
editor just to drown in mundane tasks (307.0 - 311.639)
when the initial coding is (309.84 - 313.919)
complete this was the conviction behind (311.639 - 316.36)
our copal X Vision announcement in March (313.919 - 318.52)
it was the first view of AI sailing (316.36 - 320.52000000000004)
beyond the editor and infusing the (318.52 - 323.19899999999996)
entire developer life cycle and we did (320.52 - 325.12)
not let that Vision Escape us and in the (323.199 - 327.44)
last eight months we created something (325.12 - 328.479)
even (327.44 - 330.96)
bigger in a world where developer (328.479 - 333.479)
shortages on wise in a world where (330.96 - 335.84)
billions of lines of code form the (333.479 - 338.56)
foundation of the global economy in a (335.84 - 340.52)
world where developers are still (338.56 - 343.319)
expected to keep up with Cobalt Legacy (340.52 - 345.52)
code dating back to the (343.319 - 348.72)
1960s and yet still build for tomorrow (345.52 - 350.71999999999997)
we simply have to make it easier for (348.72 - 353.56)
developers to do it all and to do it all (350.72 - 354.56)
with a (353.56 - 357.0)
co-pilot just as GitHub was founded on (354.56 - 361.96)
git today we're ref found founded on (357.0 - 361.96)
co-pilot AI is now the electricity (365.479 - 370.31899999999996)
powering the home for the world's (368.28 - 373.0)
developers in just a short time the pair (370.319 - 374.84000000000003)
programmer that started it all has (373.0 - 377.919)
evolved expanded and transformed giab (374.84 - 381.039)
into the AI power developer (377.919 - 384.28)
platform from the idea to the issue to (381.039 - 386.31899999999996)
building and coding to reviewing (384.28 - 389.599)
securing deploying to get up.com itself (386.319 - 392.72)
up is now powered by co-pilot every step (389.599 - 395.24)
and this is real today and we're going (392.72 - 397.86)
to show it to you right (395.24 - 398.2)
[Music] (397.86 - 400.81)
[Applause] (398.2 - 405.8)
[Music] (400.81 - 409.919)
now now back in March we shared co-pilot (405.8 - 412.8)
chat our vision for conversational (409.919 - 416.15999999999997)
assistance with all of you for the very (412.8 - 418.68)
first time built right into your (416.16 - 420.03900000000004)
favorite editor (418.68 - 423.479)
we designed chat to help every developer (420.039 - 426.639)
build the big picture all in natural (423.479 - 429.71999999999997)
language we've made chat even more (426.639 - 433.44)
powerful since but seeing is believing (429.72 - 437.0)
right the contribution graph is cool but (433.44 - 439.599)
today I thought it'd be even cooler to (437.0 - 442.96)
build a new app called myir commit. (439.599 - 446.28)
comom to figure out when mine and every (442.96 - 448.63899999999995)
developer on github's first commit (446.28 - 450.11999999999995)
happened (448.639 - 454.24)
now we can see who in here is the real (450.12 - 456.12)
OG of (454.24 - 459.16)
GitHub my least favorite part about (456.12 - 461.639)
starting a new project is the starting (459.16 - 465.36)
part who likes a blank space after all (461.639 - 468.08)
thankfully co-pilot has me covered with (465.36 - 471.8)
chat I'll be able to explain what I need (468.08 - 475.0)
all in natural language and Skip all the (471.8 - 477.199)
boring project set (475.0 - 480.28)
up I'm going to open the chat panel in (477.199 - 483.159)
my Editor to give me a bit more space to (480.28 - 486.35999999999996)
read and then we're going to use a new (483.159 - 489.36)
slash command to generate an entire (486.36 - 492.56)
project in Visual Studio code if you (489.36 - 494.68)
haven't used slash commands before (492.56 - 497.319)
they're a powerful tool to help you (494.68 - 500.199)
execute your most common chat commands (497.319 - 502.56)
with just a single (500.199 - 505.91900000000004)
word saving you even more (502.56 - 507.8)
keystrokes I've got a list of (505.919 - 510.35999999999996)
requirements already in my head so I'll (507.8 - 513.2)
feed those into the new command and let (510.36 - 516.36)
co-pilot build the scaffolding I need (513.2 - 519.479)
we're going to use nextjs with react (516.36 - 522.36)
components and our design system primer (519.479 - 525.44)
and we'll call the app my first commit (522.36 - 527.48)
you'll notice how co-pilot gives me the (525.44 - 529.72)
structure for my new project so I could (527.48 - 532.399)
create it right here but I'm going to (529.72 - 534.399)
jump to a workspace co-pilot created for (532.399 - 536.64)
me earlier that I've already started (534.399 - 538.2)
tinkering (536.64 - 540.56)
with let's see what we're working with (538.2 - 543.399)
here by heading to simple browser and (540.56 - 546.16)
typing in Thomas's (543.399 - 548.519)
handle okay we've got basic page (546.16 - 550.8)
navigation and most of Thomas's info (548.519 - 552.9590000000001)
right honestly I think you look better (550.8 - 556.16)
here Thomas just kidding so let's go (552.959 - 559.079)
ahead and replace this hardcoded image (556.16 - 561.519)
with the actual picture from his user (559.079 - 566.519)
data I'll select the URL delete and (561.519 - 569.9590000000001)
co-pilot comes to the rescue I'll save (566.519 - 573.32)
that and it's generally a good idea to (569.959 - 576.16)
keep tabs on the boss so I'm going to (573.32 - 579.0790000000001)
add location here as well we'll see (576.16 - 581.36)
co-pilot is giving me exactly what I (579.079 - 584.8389999999999)
need it never fails to be magical and we (581.36 - 587.0790000000001)
also need to add this in the (584.839 - 590.519)
UI and look because we added location to (587.079 - 592.8389999999999)
our data co-pilot is smart enough to (590.519 - 594.44)
know that now we want to add it to the (592.839 - 598.24)
page tab save head back to the simple (594.44 - 602.36)
browser there's the Thomas we know and (598.24 - 605.88)
love okay it's time to grab that first (602.36 - 608.88)
commit now it's been a little while (605.88 - 611.6)
since I've used GitHub search API so I'm (608.88 - 613.92)
going to ask for a little bit of help (611.6 - 615.32)
from (613.92 - 617.76)
co-pilot and don't you love when you can (615.32 - 622.24)
type perfectly on stage Under (617.76 - 622.24)
Pressure all right we're going to ask (622.48 - 628.04)
co-pilot give it a second to (624.72 - 630.6)
think always likes to get my heart rate (628.04 - 633.399)
up just a little bit uh and but it (630.6 - 635.399)
always comes through it's giving me (633.399 - 639.04)
exactly what I need I'm going to review (635.399 - 642.76)
this really fast that looks great head (639.04 - 645.399)
back over here to my editor and we're (642.76 - 648.4399999999999)
going to insert this with just one (645.399 - 651.32)
click that'll bug me if I don't fix it (648.44 - 654.9590000000001)
now great we've got that started now I (651.32 - 658.0400000000001)
need to include the commit date (654.959 - 660.279)
here (658.04 - 663.5999999999999)
looks awesome and once again we have to (660.279 - 665.48)
update our (663.6 - 669.6800000000001)
UI all right co-pilot 99% there but we (665.48 - 673.8000000000001)
want our first commit so we'll save head (669.68 - 677.279)
back okay we're almost there but I'm (673.8 - 680.24)
pretty sure that data is wrong and it (677.279 - 683.48)
looks a little funky let's see what's (680.24 - 685.44)
happening all (683.48 - 688.36)
right ah I see what I've done here I (685.44 - 691.48)
don't have any ordering in so I'm going (688.36 - 694.24)
to go ahead and select this and we're (691.48 - 696.0790000000001)
going to use chat to help us figure out (694.24 - 699.16)
how to sort our commits here I'll head (696.079 - 703.76)
back and I'm going to say update to (699.16 - 709.519)
include uh to include or sorry to sort (703.76 - 713.2)
rather by committer (709.519 - 713.2)
date give it a second to (713.399 - 720.48)
think all right that's looking (716.36 - 725.0)
good but you know when I when I'm on (720.48 - 727.5600000000001)
stage I kind of get asscending and (725.0 - 730.2)
descending mixed up um and I need the (727.56 - 732.7199999999999)
oldest commits first so I'm going to ask (730.2 - 736.639)
co-pilot to revise this answer by simply (732.72 - 740.32)
asking for the oldest or to newest sort (736.639 - 743.5600000000001)
sort by oldest to (740.32 - 747.1600000000001)
newest this is great because I can ask (743.56 - 750.3599999999999)
co-pilot exactly what's in my mind and (747.16 - 753.88)
it can translate it into the code I need (750.36 - 756.0790000000001)
we'll take a look (753.88 - 758.8389999999999)
here all right that looks good we'll go (756.079 - 762.399)
ahead and replace the line select save (758.839 - 765.9200000000001)
oh we've got something going on here all (762.399 - 768.36)
right you know what I'm under time (765.92 - 770.959)
pressure here so I'm just going to (768.36 - 773.16)
replace this with my (770.959 - 775.5189999999999)
trusty demo (773.16 - 778.48)
save if anyone was second guessing if (775.519 - 780.76)
this was live or not you've uh just got (778.48 - 781.9590000000001)
your (780.76 - 785.079)
answer all right this is looking good (781.959 - 787.88)
but 2009 I was more worried about (785.079 - 790.3199999999999)
getting my driver's license that year uh (787.88 - 792.8)
rather than committing code um but I (790.32 - 794.48)
really don't need it down to the minute (792.8 - 797.4399999999999)
so let's go ahead and clean that up and (794.48 - 799.8000000000001)
rather than using the side panel like (797.44 - 802.36)
I've been doing I can actually get (799.8 - 805.399)
co-pilot to help me right in the editor (802.36 - 806.8000000000001)
right on the line of code that I'm (805.399 - 809.36)
working on by pressing command or (806.8 - 812.3199999999999)
control I so for this line let's ask to (809.36 - 817.24)
get rid of the time remove Time and Time (812.32 - 821.0790000000001)
Zone we'll give it a second to think and (817.24 - 824.24)
ah you know I really love this new diff (821.079 - 827.0)
view because I can inspect the change (824.24 - 829.72)
before I actually agree to take it and (827.0 - 831.8)

let's head back we're going to select (848.16 - 852.56)
the function we've been working in and (850.199 - 854.199)
we're going to bring up co-pilot using (852.56 - 857.5999999999999)
inline chat one last time and use our (854.199 - 860.8389999999999)

or procrastinating in the morning when (929.48 - 933.399)
you can't quite get out of (931.519 - 937.319)
bed co-pilot chat is now in your IDE (933.399 - 939.839)
it's coming to GitHub mobile and it's (937.319 - 941.56)
getting way more (939.839 - 944.639)
powerful we've upgraded co-pilot chat (941.56 - 948.04)
with the power of GPT 4 and even more (944.639 - 951.279)
context from your editor slash commands (948.04 - 954.079)
and smart actions so I'm only ever a (951.279 - 956.0)
click away from solving my next (954.079 - 959.959)
development task and find finally inline (956.0 - 963.079)
chat to help you iterate on co- on code (959.959 - 965.8)
with co-pilot without ever having to (963.079 - 967.16)
move your (965.8 - 970.04)
mouse everything I just rattled off (967.16 - 972.92)
including the upgrades to co-pilot chat (970.04 - 975.4399999999999)
chat coming to mobile jet brains and (972.92 - 978.16)
even co-pilot in the CLI will be in your (975.44 - 980.1600000000001)
existing co-pilot (978.16 - 981.759)
subscription (980.16 - 985.04)
yes you definitely heard that right if (981.759 - 987.92)
you've got a co-pilot subscription today (985.04 - 990.519)
all of these features are coming to you (987.92 - 992.7199999999999)
but when you might (990.519 - 996.92)
ask next month co-pilot chat will be (992.72 - 1000.88)
generally available in just a few short (996.92 - 1004.519)
weeks all of this taken together will (1000.88 - 1008.319)
make natural language a new Universal (1004.519 - 1011.36)

up until now co-pilot was just about (1022.36 - 1029.079)
co-generation that's changing today (1025.559 - 1031.48)
GitHub is the AI powered developer (1029.079 - 1034.24)
platform from pull requests to security (1031.48 - 1036.1200000000001)
to security scanning to your (1034.24 - 1039.439)
repositories and more co-pilot is now (1036.12 - 1041.559)
integrated into every step of the (1039.439 - 1044.039)
developer workflow let me show you what (1041.559 - 1047.28)
I mean so I've been working on styling (1044.039 - 1049.12)
the my first commit app that Allison (1047.28 - 1051.6399999999999)
just started it's coming along very (1049.12 - 1055.6399999999999)
nicely take a look but I noticed that (1051.64 - 1058.039)
Thomas has been busy and he submitted (1055.64 - 1062.4)
not one but two PRS so let's take a look (1058.039 - 1065.039)
at the first (1062.4 - 1065.039)
one okay so it looks like there are a (1067.799 - 1073.32)
lot of file changes here but I'm not (1071.28 - 1078.08)
seeing any test Oh Thomas coding 55% (1073.32 - 1080.12)
fast F doesn't mean you get to write bad (1078.08 - 1084.3999999999999)
code 55% faster so I'm going to open up (1080.12 - 1087.08)
this in a code space real quick because (1084.4 - 1088.3600000000001)
even though Thomas wants to get this (1087.08 - 1090.32)
done quickly I don't feel comfortable (1088.36 - 1092.52)
merging this without at least one unit (1090.32 - 1095.4399999999998)
test and when I open up this in a code (1092.52 - 1097.28)
space I don't even have to touch my (1095.44 - 1100.52)
local files I can edit and make changes (1097.28 - 1104.44)
in an isolated Dev environment in the (1100.52 - 1108.48)
cloud all right so I have the user card (1104.44 - 1111.1200000000001)
JS component open if I highlight the (1108.48 - 1112.96)
entire (1111.12 - 1115.9599999999998)
component pop open CoPilot chat and type (1112.96 - 1118.559)
slash (1115.96 - 1118.559)
test co-pilot is going to automatically (1118.919 - 1124.72)
generate an entire test suite for this (1121.88 - 1127.0390000000002)
component here it is telling me exactly (1124.72 - 1129.159)
what it's going to do then it gives me (1127.039 - 1131.44)
the test and then it tells me how to run (1129.159 - 1135.64)
it wow how cool is that let me save this (1131.44 - 1139.44)
new test in a file I'm going to call it (1135.64 - 1142.6000000000001)
userc card. (1139.44 - 1142.6000000000001)
test.js awesome now let me commit my (1142.88 - 1148.0390000000002)
changes real (1146.4 - 1150.64)
quick because what I'm about to show you (1148.039 - 1154.559)
next is a game (1150.64 - 1154.5590000000002)
Cher now what I'm about to show you for (1156.799 - 1164.1589999999999)
the very first time is GitHub copilot (1161.0 - 1167.24)
chat integrated directly into github.com (1164.159 - 1171.0)
that's right co-pilot has now expended (1167.24 - 1174.24)
out of the editor let's take a look so (1171.0 - 1177.08)
if I go back to the pr and I go to let's (1174.24 - 1181.919)
say index.js and select lines 25 through (1177.08 - 1184.9189999999999)
45 click on the co-pilot icon that pops (1181.919 - 1188.96)
up and type please explain this code I (1184.919 - 1190.7990000000002)
always like to say please to the AI (1188.96 - 1193.8400000000001)
because you just never (1190.799 - 1197.2)
know but take a look at this co-pilot (1193.84 - 1199.32)
chat is telling me exactly what this (1197.2 - 1201.72)
code is doing and it even went as far as (1199.32 - 1204.12)
breaking down the code into chunks so (1201.72 - 1207.72)
it's easy for me to read and understand (1204.12 - 1209.9189999999999)
this is the power of copilot chat in (1207.72 - 1211.76)
github.com (1209.919 - 1214.3200000000002)
now let's go back to the pr because I (1211.76 - 1218.559)
noticed that the description was a bit (1214.32 - 1221.9189999999999)
lacking by the way did you know that (1218.559 - 1225.12)
around 40% of pull requests don't have a (1221.919 - 1229.72)
description yeah let's fix that (1225.12 - 1231.52)
so we've added a new icon here for (1229.72 - 1234.0)
co-pilot actions if I click on this (1231.52 - 1236.6399999999999)
summary command that pops up co-pilot is (1234.0 - 1239.96)
going to help us generate a detailed PR (1236.64 - 1242.88)
description co-pilot is no longer just (1239.96 - 1245.559)
in your editor it is now integrated into (1242.88 - 1247.919)
PRS to help you with the mundane stuff (1245.559 - 1251.12)
like writing PR descriptions think about (1247.919 - 1253.5590000000002)
how long it takes you to come up with a (1251.12 - 1257.12)
meaningful summary of all your (1253.559 - 1259.0)
work (1257.12 - 1261.76)
let's just given a minute woof would you (1259.0 - 1263.76)
look at (1261.76 - 1267.1589999999999)
that co-pilot just generated an entire (1263.76 - 1269.919)
description very detailed of all the (1267.159 - 1272.3200000000002)
changes that we've made so far it even (1269.919 - 1274.1200000000001)
included little clicky links that I (1272.32 - 1276.36)
never would have bothered to add (1274.12 - 1279.52)
myself awesome now let's take a look at (1276.36 - 1282.0)
that second (1279.52 - 1282.0)
PR okay so it looks like there's a (1285.159 - 1290.7600000000002)
security issue around an unsanitized (1288.32 - 1293.279)
user input we know that with GI up (1290.76 - 1295.48)
Advanced security code scanning has (1293.279 - 1297.48)
always been able to find vulnerabilities (1295.48 - 1300.72)
in your code but now you don't just get (1297.48 - 1303.4)
a notification there's a complete fix (1300.72 - 1307.039)
suggested right here with the power of (1303.4 - 1311.159)

it suggests the changes you need to make (1311.159 - 1314.88)
to fix security (1313.039 - 1318.72)
vulnerabilities if I click here click (1314.88 - 1320.96)
commit (1318.72 - 1324.559)
changes and just like that we're (1320.96 - 1327.559)
secure (1324.559 - 1327.559)
this this is what we mean when we say (1330.72 - 1335.76)
that GitHub is the AI powered developer (1332.96 - 1339.32)

that don't have patterns like password (1374.96 - 1378.919)
stored and Source control control the (1376.919 - 1380.88)
cause of some of the most expensive (1378.919 - 1385.279)
exploits over recent years now as we all (1380.88 - 1387.88)
know the two hardest problems in (1385.279 - 1390.72)

we are truly bringing AI to every part (1412.159 - 1418.8400000000001)
of the GitHub platform and that means (1415.24 - 1422.52)
every part github.com is the homepage (1418.84 - 1424.76)
for software development where every (1422.52 - 1426.96)
project can begin where developers (1424.76 - 1429.039)
collaborate and where the open source (1426.96 - 1430.88)
Community builds and maintains the (1429.039 - 1434.52)
world's code now we're integrating (1430.88 - 1439.2)
co-pilot directly into github.com (1434.52 - 1439.2)
W this means you can dig into code (1440.279 - 1446.159)
generate pull requests and make the rest (1444.0 - 1451.36)

co-pilot as we've just seen code (1457.24 - 1463.279)
generation is an incredible tool but one (1460.12 - 1464.9599999999998)
of the most challenging tasks when (1463.279 - 1467.559)
building software is understanding the (1464.96 - 1470.3600000000001)
comp complex systems we all work on (1467.559 - 1472.76)
developers today work on large (1470.36 - 1475.6)
multi-service multiplatform multi (1472.76 - 1478.919)
language and often Legacy code bases to (1475.6 - 1482.1999999999998)
succeed we have to build off a complex (1478.919 - 1484.8400000000001)
Foundation understanding all that code (1482.2 - 1487.64)
that came before us with github's (1484.84 - 1490.1589999999999)
powerful code intelligence co-pilot can (1487.64 - 1492.159)
help us get the critical information we (1490.159 - 1495.72)
need so we can build more faster let me (1492.159 - 1499.7600000000002)
show you how it works (1495.72 - 1499.76)
now hold on I'm logged in here to my (1499.96 - 1505.8400000000001)
personal account let me jump to my work (1503.039 - 1508.12)
account so I can show you how co-pilot (1505.84 - 1510.9599999999998)
works for me as an employee here at (1508.12 - 1513.559)
GitHub I'll use this brand new feature (1510.96 - 1516.24)
on github.com where I can switch users (1513.559 - 1519.08)
with a single (1516.24 - 1519.08)
click that's (1520.399 - 1525.8799999999999)
better all right let's ask co-pilot a (1523.0 - 1529.679)
question about shortening urls (1525.88 - 1529.679)
how would I create a short link for my (1529.76 - 1534.1589999999999)
first (1531.919 - 1534.159)
commit large language models like the (1534.48 - 1539.84)
ones that the power co-pilot have strong (1537.24 - 1541.679)
generalist knowledge of programming (1539.84 - 1543.9189999999999)
languages open- Source libraries and (1541.679 - 1546.5590000000002)
popular Frameworks you can see here it's (1543.919 - 1548.24)
suggested we use (1546.559 - 1551.24)
bitly now we've heard from organizations (1548.24 - 1553.72)
and developers that you want co-pilot to (1551.24 - 1557.32)
know more about you your code your (1553.72 - 1559.96)
document mentation your poll requests (1557.32 - 1563.279)
and we built just that now co-pilot is (1559.96 - 1567.2)
an expert on your company's codebase to (1563.279 - 1569.399)
today what I'm about to show you for the (1567.2 - 1572.799)
very first time is co-pilot customized (1569.399 - 1574.9189999999999)
to your (1572.799 - 1578.44)
organization here let's Point co-pilot (1574.919 - 1580.88)
at our Internal Documentation site at (1578.44 - 1583.3990000000001)
GitHub we call our internal doc site The (1580.88 - 1586.2)
Hub and we have our own internal URL (1583.399 - 1588.36)
shortener GH (1586.2 - 1591.3990000000001)
IO I'll ask the same question (1588.36 - 1594.12)
again how would I create a short link (1591.399 - 1596.9189999999999)
for my first (1594.12 - 1596.9189999999999)
commit and now co-pilot is searching (1597.12 - 1602.36)
through our Internal Documentation and (1599.96 - 1605.08)
using it to answer our question so you (1602.36 - 1607.6399999999999)
can see here it not only knows the (1605.08 - 1609.48)
correct chatops command to be able to (1607.64 - 1611.8400000000001)
create a short link using our internal (1609.48 - 1614.48)
service it's inferring from my question (1611.84 - 1616.72)
what data to use in the command and it's (1614.48 - 1618.64)
even giving me an examp example of how I (1616.72 - 1619.76)
could use (1618.64 - 1623.039)
it let me show you another example this (1619.76 - 1626.6)
time using a project that I work (1623.039 - 1626.6)
on last year at Universe we announced (1627.399 - 1632.8799999999999)
github's allnew code search engine code (1630.0 - 1635.84)
named Blackbird and when we built it we (1632.88 - 1637.8400000000001)
invented a new data structure to make (1635.84 - 1641.279)
search super fast even at github's huge (1637.84 - 1643.9189999999999)
scale we call that data structure the (1641.279 - 1645.24)
geometric (1643.919 - 1648.24)
filter our last co-pilot what is the (1645.24 - 1649.679)
geometric (1648.24 - 1653.0)
filter now we haven't published any (1649.679 - 1656.0800000000002)
information about it publicly but now (1653.0 - 1658.2)
because I've given co-pilot access to (1656.08 - 1661.399)
this repo it can answer my questions (1658.2 - 1662.64)
about my (1661.399 - 1664.5189999999998)
code take a look at the answer it's (1662.64 - 1666.88)
giving us co-pilot is referencing (1664.519 - 1669.64)
specific files and giving us a breakdown (1666.88 - 1672.279)
of exactly how this data structure (1669.64 - 1674.76)
works this answer is about as good as (1672.279 - 1676.919)
you'd get from any member of the (1674.76 - 1678.679)
Blackbird team (1676.919 - 1681.8400000000001)
team think about what that means with (1678.679 - 1684.039)
co-pilot you now have an expert (1681.84 - 1686.36)
available anytime to answer questions (1684.039 - 1688.679)
about your code base right from your (1686.36 - 1690.76)
browser or (1688.679 - 1694.159)
ID and we're not done we're taking the (1690.76 - 1695.72)
next (1694.159 - 1698.7600000000002)
step we're now trialing fine-tuning the (1695.72 - 1701.1200000000001)
language model itself for several large (1698.76 - 1703.2)
customers including (1701.12 - 1706.7199999999998)
AMD by taking a model like gp4 and (1703.2 - 1709.279)
fine-tuning on your company's code base (1706.72 - 1711.679)
co-pilot quickly learns to adapt to your (1709.279 - 1714.2)
company's unique coding style and (1711.679 - 1716.519)
conventions we've seen that fine-tuning (1714.2 - 1718.519)
the model for customers with unique code (1716.519 - 1720.76)
bases can bring a massive performance (1718.519 - 1723.24)
Improvement to their engineering teams (1720.76 - 1725.039)
when combined with github's powerful (1723.24 - 1726.919)
code intelligence and advanced (1725.039 - 1729.399)
fine-tuning co-pilot will feel right at (1726.919 - 1731.5590000000002)
home in your organization and help your (1729.399 - 1735.799)
company build even better (1731.559 - 1735.799)
together (1736.399 - 1739.399)
but what about information that lives (1740.519 - 1744.64)
outside of GitHub as developers we all (1741.84 - 1747.08)
have a whole ecosystem of tools like (1744.64 - 1749.48)
deployment infrastructure monitoring (1747.08 - 1752.8799999999999)
feature flags and more with co-pilot we (1749.48 - 1754.799)
can now bring information from all of (1752.88 - 1758.0)
these surfaces together in one (1754.799 - 1761.279)
place imagine right from github.com or (1758.0 - 1763.24)
your IDE being able to check the (1761.279 - 1764.88)
performance of a database query in (1763.24 - 1767.08)
production by asking data Stacks how (1764.88 - 1770.159)
it's performing using our new apis for (1767.08 - 1772.9189999999999)
co-pilot developers can extend co-pilot (1770.159 - 1775.7600000000002)
for nearly any use case right within (1772.919 - 1778.159)
chat you could even check the status of (1775.76 - 1780.8799999999999)
a feature flag using launch Darkly or (1778.159 - 1783.7600000000002)
ask Postman if you're using an API (1780.88 - 1786.0)
correctly we're kicking off the early (1783.76 - 1788.32)
phases of this program with our debut (1786.0 - 1790.679)
Partners as part of our new GitHub (1788.32 - 1792.799)
co-pilot partner (1790.679 - 1795.96)
program including Red Hat hashy Corp (1792.799 - 1798.48)
data dog and more (1795.96 - 1801.2)
we can't wait to see what you'll (1798.48 - 1804.159)
build it's been a year since Chad GPD (1801.2 - 1806.64)
sparked the Gen Revolution and kicked (1804.159 - 1809.1200000000001)
off a new era of innovation in both (1806.64 - 1810.919)
business and software engineering take (1809.12 - 1813.6789999999999)
one since that moment Accenture and (1810.919 - 1815.76)
GitHub have been working together to (1813.679 - 1817.72)
make the promise of AI assisted software (1815.76 - 1820.6)
development real at Accenture we (1817.72 - 1822.88)
consider ourselves customer zero for (1820.6 - 1825.9189999999999)
GitHub we experiment scale and share our (1822.88 - 1828.72)
learnings from our own usage and client (1825.919 - 1830.72)
engagements to help GitHub innovate (1828.72 - 1833.799)
faster we were the first global company (1830.72 - 1837.039)
of our size to Pilot GitHub co-pilot and (1833.799 - 1840.0)
we quickly learned a few key things (1837.039 - 1842.679)
first the promise of efficiency gains (1840.0 - 1845.64)
are real across multiple phases of the (1842.679 - 1848.24)
software delivery life cycle the real (1845.64 - 1851.279)
value comes from Speed code quality and (1848.24 - 1853.559)
security and developer experience and (1851.279 - 1855.679)
where we see the biggest opportunity is (1853.559 - 1857.36)
integrating co-pilot into an an (1855.679 - 1859.279)
organization's end to-end automation (1857.36 - 1862.559)
framework now Accenture and GitHub are (1859.279 - 1864.2)
helping clients move Beyond (1862.559 - 1866.6789999999999)
experimentation to make AI assisted (1864.2 - 1869.0)
technology delivery pervasive we're (1866.679 - 1873.0)
doing this by one co-developing specific (1869.0 - 1876.519)
Solutions using co-pilot two integrating (1873.0 - 1879.36)
co-pilot into accenture's own automation (1876.519 - 1882.279)
platforms and three by expanding (1879.36 - 1885.399)

coming to your mobile devices it's (1938.84 - 1942.039)
coming to the comment line it's coming (1940.159 - 1945.24)
to jetbrains idees and I'm happy to (1942.039 - 1947.639)
announce that all of this every feature (1945.24 - 1950.6)
I just said is included in your co-pilot (1947.639 - 1952.9189999999999)

free for teachers students and (1966.12 - 1970.5189999999998)
maintainers of popular open source (1968.24 - 1973.36)
projects but on top of all of this we've (1970.519 - 1975.519)
consistently heard from many of our (1973.36 - 1977.7199999999998)
Enterprise customers that they would (1975.519 - 1980.32)
love to have the internal knowledge of (1977.72 - 1983.559)
their organization and co-pilot today (1980.32 - 1985.279)
we're bringing this customization (1983.559 - 1987.12)
together with every single co-pilot (1985.279 - 1990.559)
feature into a new product that we call (1987.12 - 1993.6789999999999)

a new wave of digital transformation as (2054.96 - 2060.04)
we know it and create a competitive (2057.679 - 2063.119)
Advantage for every organization in our (2060.04 - 2066.48)
world that is dependent on software but (2063.119 - 2068.96)
don't just take it for me today we have (2066.48 - 2071.399)
got a special guest who knows quite a (2068.96 - 2074.119)
lot about digitally transforming an (2071.399 - 2076.919)
organization please join me in welcoming (2074.119 - 2078.839)
for the very first time ever at giup (2076.919 - 2082.8199999999997)
Universe the CEO of Microsoft SAA (2078.839 - 2088.56)
[Applause] (2082.82 - 2090.9190000000003)
nadela great to see you (2088.56 - 2094.159)
s thank you so much SAA I introduced you (2090.919 - 2095.56)
as the CEO of Microsoft but you're (2094.159 - 2097.359)
really the biggest Super Fan of get (2095.56 - 2099.92)
co-pilot no I am I mean in fact I was (2097.359 - 2101.4)
just you know listening to all the (2099.92 - 2103.2000000000003)
announcements and reading up about it (2101.4 - 2106.2400000000002)
and I must say in the last what a year (2103.2 - 2108.48)
year and a half maybe since I've been (2106.24 - 2111.56)
using get up co-pilot my weekends have (2108.48 - 2114.92)
changed you know I I can code again I (2111.56 - 2117.32)
mean the joy of coding is back I'd say (2114.92 - 2119.96)
code spaces co-pilot and now I'm really (2117.32 - 2122.2000000000003)
looking forward to co-pilot on GI up.com (2119.96 - 2124.56)
because man it'll be so fun to just go (2122.2 - 2127.04)
to repo after repo and keep reading (2124.56 - 2129.68)
explain this explain this explain this (2127.04 - 2133.2)
I'll remember to say please (2129.68 - 2135.8799999999997)
yeah and it's it's been 5 years you know (2133.2 - 2137.96)
then since Microsoft acquired GitHub and (2135.88 - 2140.28)
our industry has changed so much since (2137.96 - 2142.56)
then how do you how has our work (2140.28 - 2144.32)
together you know led us to this moment (2142.56 - 2147.0)
with K yeah it's it's unbelievable it's (2144.32 - 2150.88)
five years uh since obviously uh we got (2147.0 - 2153.92)
to sort of Steward uh GitHub you know (2150.88 - 2155.96)
when I think about Microsoft Thomas to (2153.92 - 2157.839)
me I'm always grounding myself right we (2155.96 - 2159.96)
were a developer company first after all (2157.839 - 2161.88)
the company got started creating Dev (2159.96 - 2164.52)
tools I always remind myself of that and (2161.88 - 2166.319)
that's our core Heritage we're a (2164.52 - 2168.96)
platform company right so we build uh (2166.319 - 2170.7599999999998)
platforms so the developers can then (2168.96 - 2173.319)
build great IP on top of it and we are a (2170.76 - 2175.119)
partner company which is helped those (2173.319 - 2176.599)
developers be successful in the (2175.119 - 2179.319)
marketplace and that's at the core who (2176.599 - 2181.3590000000004)
we are and quite frankly GitHub has (2179.319 - 2183.92)
taken us to another level right our (2181.359 - 2186.4)
ability to one we did a lot of work (2183.92 - 2188.56)
before before we even decided to that we (2186.4 - 2191.44)
had the right to Steward GitHub we made (2188.56 - 2193.359)
sure that we were great members of the (2191.44 - 2195.2400000000002)
open source Community by really being (2193.359 - 2196.7999999999997)
part of the community contributing to (2195.24 - 2198.5989999999997)
the community and that's what led us to (2196.8 - 2201.599)
that so it's been a fantastic journey (2198.599 - 2204.079)
and here we are at this moment with (2201.599 - 2206.6400000000003)
co-pilot and Ai and ready for what is I (2204.079 - 2208.28)
think the next phase of our developer (2206.64 - 2210.4)
Journey yeah awesome and I you mentioned (2208.28 - 2211.8390000000004)
a lot of companies you meet with a lot (2210.4 - 2213.88)
of developers around the world you get (2211.839 - 2215.64)
to meet with a lot of CEOs that hire (2213.88 - 2218.0)
developers to drive their transformation (2215.64 - 2219.64)
what do we hear from them and how can (2218.0 - 2221.4)
co-pilot help them yeah it's it's (2219.64 - 2223.5989999999997)
fantastic I mean even just listening to (2221.4 - 2226.2000000000003)
the video you just played um and talked (2223.599 - 2227.8)
about I mean think about this this is an (2226.2 - 2229.4399999999996)
you know an at scale organization like (2227.8 - 2231.52)
Accenture making the decision to go (2229.44 - 2234.0)
deploy uh something like get up co-pilot (2231.52 - 2237.04)
uh Enterprise wide uh that's a big thing (2234.0 - 2238.92)
usually if you sort of look at the dev (2237.04 - 2241.92)
tools business and Dev stool diffusion (2238.92 - 2244.04)
it takes decades before those (2241.92 - 2245.8)
enterprise-wide things happen and this (2244.04 - 2247.72)
is just happening you know in you know (2245.8 - 2250.4)
in less than a year perhaps couple of (2247.72 - 2253.04)
things one at the end of the day to me I (2250.4 - 2255.8)
think all of us uh we want to make sure (2253.04 - 2258.48)
that the people we work with have the (2255.8 - 2260.8390000000004)
best tools to so that they feel (2258.48 - 2263.2400000000002)
empowered they feel that they can stay (2260.839 - 2266.16)
in flow they can do their very best work (2263.24 - 2268.24)
and then of course the organization (2266.16 - 2269.7599999999998)
benefits from that in terms of (2268.24 - 2271.7999999999997)
productivity gains so the unquestionable (2269.76 - 2274.1600000000003)
stuff uh is some of the productivity (2271.8 - 2275.8390000000004)
stats and the productivity stats by the (2274.16 - 2278.3999999999996)
way is not just stats it's about (2275.839 - 2280.839)
ultimately removing some of the drudgery (2278.4 - 2283.319)
bringing the joy back helping you stay (2280.839 - 2285.7999999999997)
in flow who doesn't appreciate that (2283.319 - 2287.4)
right every developer appreciates that (2285.8 - 2289.3590000000004)
and every de Dev manager appreciates (2287.4 - 2292.4)
that and so to me uh that's what we hear (2289.359 - 2294.04)
uh and really the other thing that I (2292.4 - 2296.92)
would say is I've always felt like when (2294.04 - 2298.8)
you introduce GitHub into an (2296.92 - 2301.48)
organization workflow changes right we' (2298.8 - 2303.119)
always said like when the (2301.48 - 2305.599)
salesperson is you know doing a pull (2303.119 - 2307.839)
request it's it's a different or it's (2305.599 - 2311.079)
moving at the speed of code so now think (2307.839 - 2314.0789999999997)
about it right with co-pilot and that (2311.079 - 2316.2000000000003)
speed of code fundamentally changing (2314.079 - 2318.44)
what it means to what is a digital (2316.2 - 2320.0)
economy right there's if you're in the (2318.44 - 2321.48)
Auto industry you're in the financial (2320.0 - 2323.56)
industry you're in the farma industry (2321.48 - 2326.319)
every pretty much everybody is a digital (2323.56 - 2328.68)
company and a software company and so I (2326.319 - 2332.16)
I'm very excited culturally how do the (2328.68 - 2334.64)
organizations change how does work and (2332.16 - 2337.839)
workflow change uh across all functions (2334.64 - 2339.359)
it's just not the professional software (2337.839 - 2341.68)
developer but everyone around them is (2339.359 - 2343.88)
collaborating and really making it a (2341.68 - 2345.7999999999997)
much more realtime digital organization (2343.88 - 2347.76)
so that's the most exciting thing that I (2345.8 - 2349.1600000000003)
think everyone in this room gets to (2347.76 - 2351.119)
participate in which is change their (2349.16 - 2353.1189999999997)
organization help their organization (2351.119 - 2355.0)
achieve next level of transformation and (2353.119 - 2357.079)
productivity yeah incredibly exciting (2355.0 - 2359.359)
and I I saw you I think it was a post on (2357.079 - 2361.44)
social media saying that natural (2359.359 - 2363.88)
language is becoming the new Universal (2361.44 - 2365.68)
programming language how do you think (2363.88 - 2367.76)
natural language will democratize access (2365.68 - 2369.9199999999996)
to software development yeah I mean look (2367.76 - 2372.0400000000004)
I think you know you look at all the (2369.92 - 2375.7200000000003)
demos um this morning and you feel like (2372.04 - 2378.04)
wow I can do (2375.72 - 2381.72)
that I mean all I need is co-pilot chat (2378.04 - 2383.88)
and here it is I just sort of click (2381.72 - 2386.2799999999997)
click click and I'm real tab tab tab and (2383.88 - 2389.56)
I'm done I mean this is like uh it is in (2386.28 - 2392.599)
some sense the most empowering thing is (2389.56 - 2394.56)
to be able to give right I mean we have (2392.599 - 2396.44)
what 100 plus million people already (2394.56 - 2398.4)
don't get up but my dream is like how do (2396.44 - 2400.64)
we Empower a billion people and then the (2398.4 - 2402.48)
other billions around these billion (2400.64 - 2404.44)
people who are all collaborating with (2402.48 - 2405.92)
the power of natural language because if (2404.44 - 2408.359)
I look at the Arc of computing our (2405.92 - 2410.48)
history of the last 70 years has been (2408.359 - 2413.4)
can humans in computers interact in the (2410.48 - 2416.119)
most natural way what's more powerful uh (2413.4 - 2418.04)
than natural language uh which by the (2416.119 - 2420.2400000000002)
way starts with language goes multimodal (2418.04 - 2422.599)
and so there's a lot uh to be said about (2420.24 - 2424.16)
sort of that thing that you just (2422.599 - 2425.88)
mentioned which is natural language as (2424.16 - 2429.24)
the program language um to me also the (2425.88 - 2431.1600000000003)
other comment that one of the people in (2429.24 - 2432.7599999999998)
the morning sort of said which is I (2431.16 - 2434.72)
thought struck the court with me which (2432.76 - 2437.6400000000003)
is to say wow co-pilot is the new IDE I (2434.72 - 2440.319)
mean think about the approachability (2437.64 - 2442.16)
right you know you you have a middle (2440.319 - 2445.599)
school girl first learning coding just (2442.16 - 2446.48)
the (2445.599 - 2448.8)
approachability uh to be able to say wow (2446.48 - 2451.2)
you can express some complex thought and (2448.8 - 2453.119)
start seeing code and you're going to (2451.2 - 2456.56)
get into coding that is gamechanging to (2453.119 - 2457.96)
me right because natural language is (2456.56 - 2460.7999999999997)
about accessibility it's about making (2457.96 - 2462.88)
the barrier to entry lower and it's (2460.8 - 2464.7200000000003)
going to be stunning to me the other (2462.88 - 2467.839)
thing that i' would also say um is what (2464.72 - 2469.5989999999997)
you're doing like some of the stuff that (2467.839 - 2471.56)
you're going to show and demonstrate (2469.599 - 2474.319)
around how about applying it at the repo (2471.56 - 2475.599)
scale right I think you call it (2474.319 - 2478.68)
workspace I think uh I am so excited (2475.599 - 2480.04)
about it right which is hey it's not (2478.68 - 2483.1189999999997)
just about like I go from an issue to (2480.04 - 2487.2799999999997)
code to task to deploy if we can really (2483.119 - 2490.8)
make that entire flow really magical (2487.28 - 2493.44)
with natural language and the product (2490.8 - 2496.7200000000003)
managers the marketing folks sales folks (2493.44 - 2499.44)
and developers are all communicating in (2496.72 - 2501.839)
this multi-agent framework that I think (2499.44 - 2504.16)
is going to be really Next Level maybe (2501.839 - 2505.839)
next year when we are back here we can (2504.16 - 2508.359)
start talking about some of that stuff (2505.839 - 2509.839)
incredible thank you so much for joining (2508.359 - 2514.24)
us than thank you so much thank you so (2509.839 - 2514.24)
much (2515.24 - 2518.24)
wow what incredible insights and what an (2520.88 - 2525.48)
incredible keynote it's been today we (2522.72 - 2527.839)
have shown you how developers can go (2525.48 - 2529.8)
above and beyond with the power of (2527.839 - 2532.839)
natural language and co-pilot and we (2529.8 - 2535.319)
truly think this AI power developer (2532.839 - 2538.72)
platform will change the world thank you (2535.319 - 2541.0)
for being part of all of this and thank (2538.72 - 2543.5589999999997)
you to everybody at GitHub that worked (2541.0 - 2546.24)
so hard in the last few weeks to get us (2543.559 - 2548.7200000000003)
to this moment and please give it up for (2546.24 - 2553.24)
our presenters Allison kadesha and (2548.72 - 2553.24)
Colin (2554.319 - 2559.04)
but wait wait wait don't don't switch (2556.839 - 2561.52)
off if you're online I I think I forgot (2559.04 - 2564.24)
something and if if you know me you know (2561.52 - 2566.28)
that even in my teenage days you know (2564.24 - 2569.359)
coding back in the 1990s I've always (2566.28 - 2573.0400000000004)
admired Steve Jobs and 13 years ago on (2569.359 - 2575.72)
the stage here in yba buana Steve (2573.04 - 2578.64)
launched the iPad and so I'm so excited (2575.72 - 2583.839)
to say this there is one more (2578.64 - 2583.839)
thing Steve talked a lot about the (2585.359 - 2590.4)
concept of machines accelerating human (2588.04 - 2593.319)
progress he described the home computer (2590.4 - 2595.88)
as the bicycle of the Mind a new (2593.319 - 2598.16)
partnership between human and machine (2595.88 - 2600.48)
that could take us far beyond our own (2598.16 - 2603.72)
inherit abilities and today I can't help (2600.48 - 2605.68)
but think that we have arrived at the (2603.72 - 2608.7999999999997)
next face of this partnership software (2605.68 - 2611.16)
developers Embrace of get up co-pilot (2608.8 - 2613.2000000000003)
has shown the world how humans can (2611.16 - 2615.68)
symbiotically partner with intelligent (2613.2 - 2619.04)
machines to make Big Ideas even easier (2615.68 - 2622.16)
to deliver today we are thrilled to (2619.04 - 2624.52)
announce an early glimpse of a (2622.16 - 2626.8799999999997)
revolutionary new future and we're (2624.52 - 2630.359)
calling it co-pilot (2626.88 - 2632.52)
workspace every day millions of (2630.359 - 2634.359)
developers start from a very familiar (2632.52 - 2637.559)
Place GitHub issues so we created an AI (2634.359 - 2639.2799999999997)
native workflow that dramatically (2637.559 - 2641.0400000000004)
simplifies the way you use natural (2639.28 - 2643.559)
language to turn these great ideas into (2641.04 - 2646.44)
code we call it the co-pilot (2643.559 - 2649.4)
workspace starting with any GitHub issue (2646.44 - 2651.2000000000003)
co-pilot workspace automatically (2649.4 - 2653.6800000000003)
proposes a solution based on its deep (2651.2 - 2655.2799999999997)
understanding of the code base issue (2653.68 - 2658.839)
replies link tasks everything co-pilot (2655.28 - 2660.96)
workspace then builds a step-by-step (2658.839 - 2663.04)
plan to implement the changes so that (2660.96 - 2665.64)
you know exactly what needs to be done (2663.04 - 2667.72)
and if isn't quite right the spec and (2665.64 - 2669.5989999999997)
plan are fully editable so you can (2667.72 - 2672.04)
easily steer co-pilot in the right (2669.599 - 2674.0)
direction once you're happy with the (2672.04 - 2676.319)
plan simply click Implement and let (2674.0 - 2677.92)
co-pilot chase down the necessary (2676.319 - 2680.64)
changes across your entire repository (2677.92 - 2682.52)
and Beyond simply synthesizing code (2680.64 - 2684.4)
co-pilot workspace builds and tests the (2682.52 - 2687.8)
changes and validates that they're (2684.4 - 2687.8)
successful it will even run your code so (2690.359 - 2695.119)
you can verify the fix visually this (2692.88 - 2696.76)
looks great (2695.119 - 2698.2000000000003)
since a workspace is designed for (2696.76 - 2700.1600000000003)
collaboration you can edit any of the (2698.2 - 2701.96)
suggested changes and if you (2700.16 - 2703.319)
accidentally introduce an error along (2701.96 - 2705.839)
the way co-pilot will automatically (2703.319 - 2708.5589999999997)
catch it repair it and rerun the code (2705.839 - 2710.2)
once the issue is fixed it's easy to (2708.559 - 2711.92)
create a pull request with a generated (2710.2 - 2714.16)
summary of your work this lets your team (2711.92 - 2717.319)
review merge and deploy faster than ever (2714.16 - 2719.2)
we're building co-pilot workspace so you (2717.319 - 2721.68)
can turn your creativity into reality (2719.2 - 2724.7999999999997)
every single (2721.68 - 2724.7999999999997)
day (2724.88 - 2727.88)
co-pirate workpace is just one of the (2733.0 - 2737.52)
Horizon Visions our team at get up next (2735.16 - 2740.319)
is developing when workspace is released (2737.52 - 2743.48)
in 2024 we will be consequential leap (2740.319 - 2745.7599999999998)
closer to an age where developers can (2743.48 - 2748.88)
use AI as a second brain to stream (2745.76 - 2751.8390000000004)
creativity into creation and minutes all (2748.88 - 2754.44)
with natural language and I think it's (2751.839 - 2756.96)
just the beginning this intersection of (2754.44 - 2759.319)
human artificial intelligence will (2756.96 - 2761.079)
continue to define the future (2759.319 - 2764.319)
generations of GitHub the AI power (2761.079 - 2766.7200000000003)
developer platform thank you so much for (2764.319 - 2769.75)
joining us today and have a great getup (2766.72 - 2771.8399999999997)
